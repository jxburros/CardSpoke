## [0.19.0] – 2026-07-16

Security, data-integrity, and plugin-runtime hardening from the 2026-07-16
pre-release audit. This release fixes a card-content exfiltration channel,
several data-loss paths, and an app-freeze bug, and closes gaps in the plugin
lifecycle.

### Security

- **Card content could be exfiltrated by a CSS-only "theme" plugin.** Card
  titles (and tags) were reflected into DOM `value="…"` attributes, which a
  plugin's CSS attribute selectors could read character-by-character and beacon
  out via `background: url(https://…)`. Two fixes: the DOM helper now sets form
  values as a live property, never as a CSS-selectable attribute; and the CSP
  `img-src` no longer allows arbitrary `https:` images (same-origin plus
  `data:`/`blob:` only), which removes the network leg of the leak. Both are
  guarded by new smoke/browser-QA regressions.

### Fixed — data integrity

- **Migrating a PIN-protected dataset wrote it in plaintext.** Storage-settings
  migration to IndexedDB or a local file serialized the store without
  encryption before the deferred encrypted save; the plaintext copy could be
  what durably remained. Migration now encrypts with the active session PIN
  exactly like the normal save path.
- **Switching datasets mid-save could destroy an encrypted dataset.** A queued
  debounced save read the *current* dataset key at fire time, so a timer
  scheduled for dataset A could fire after a switch and write A's (unencrypted)
  data into dataset B's key. Every switch now flushes the pending save to its
  own key first (and cancels it when the active dataset is being deleted).
- **Editing a card's parent to one of its own descendants froze the app.** The
  resulting parent cycle spun breadcrumb rendering forever. The parent picker
  now excludes the card's descendants, breadcrumb/ancestor/descendant walks are
  cycle-guarded, and imports repair cyclic/dangling parents before persisting.
- Undo/redo history and the trash bin are now cleared on dataset load, so one
  dataset's undo entries can no longer be replayed against — or inject a foreign
  card into — another dataset.
- Restoring a trashed card whose parent no longer exists now keeps it reachable
  at the root instead of leaving it an invisible orphan.
- `QuotaExceededError` detection now recognizes the differently-named variants
  used by some engines, so a full-storage save is reported rather than swallowed.

### Fixed — plugin runtime

- **Boot no longer deadlocks on a hung plugin.** A plugin whose `setup()` never
  resolved blocked the sequential boot sync and left a blank page; boot re-enable
  is now time-boxed, and a plugin that fails or hangs on boot is suspended so it
  cannot re-break every subsequent load.
- **Suspending a plugin can no longer remove another plugin's component
  override.** The component registry now tracks ownership: a plugin only tracks
  a slot it actually won, and cleanup only unregisters a slot it still owns.
- **A failed enable no longer leaves the app's brand permanently renamed.** The
  `appName` override is applied only after the permission check, and is restored
  on any setup failure (previously, declining a shipped sample's permission left
  the logo replaced with no way back).
- Deleting a plugin now sweeps its namespaced `ctx.storage` keys, honoring the
  documented "everything created through `ctx.api.*` is removed on delete"
  invariant (a reinstall can no longer inherit stale values).
- One plugin's throwing middleware no longer starves other plugins' hooks or
  silently prevents the core operation — each middleware runs fault-isolated.

### Fixed — editing & search

- Duplicating a card, and adding/removing tags, are now undoable; deleting a
  card with children is grouped so a single Undo restores the whole subtree.
- Advanced Search with filters but no query text now matches all cards before
  applying the tag/bookmark/date filters, instead of searching for a literal
  `*`.
- Search-results keyboard navigation is clamped to the results actually
  rendered, so arrowing past the last rendered result no longer loses the
  highlight.

### Changed

- Native `sync` scripts now build first, so `npx cap sync` can no longer package
  a stale committed bundle into the mobile shells.
- The dev-only `test.html`/`diagnostic.html` harnesses are trimmed from the
  GitHub Pages deploy (they remain in the repo for local use).
- `www/capabilities.json` advertises the current version and is covered by the
  version-consistency smoke check.

## [0.18.2] – 2026-07-10

Release-hardening fixes from the 2026-07-10 audit / QA / stress-test report.

### Fixed

- **Stale offline updates (CS-101):** the service-worker cache namespace was
  still `v0.18.0`, so returning users controlled by the old worker kept
  receiving the previous release's cache-first `app.js` indefinitely — 0.18.1
  shipped critical data-safety fixes those users never got. The cache version
  is now rewritten from `package.json` on every build (it cannot drift), shell
  assets are served stale-while-revalidate so a stale cache self-heals on the
  next online load, and both the static smoke gate and a new behavioral test
  suite (`tests/service-worker.test.js`) verify install pre-caching, the
  N → N+1 activate cleanup, revalidation, and the offline navigation fallback.
- **Dataset PIN field accessibility (CS-105):** the dataset-creation labels
  (name, storage type, PIN) are now programmatically associated with their
  controls via `for=`, and the PIN inputs reference the help text through
  `aria-describedby`.
- **PIN normalization and typo protection (CS-106):** the PIN is no longer
  silently trimmed at creation (unlock always used the exact typed value, so a
  PIN created with surrounding spaces could never unlock). PINs that start or
  end with a space, or consist only of spaces, are rejected with a clear
  message, a confirmation field with mismatch validation prevents a one-typo
  unrecoverable dataset, and the help text states the exactly-as-typed rule
  and the limits of short PINs.

### Changed

- **Browser QA is now a required deployment gate (CS-102):** `playwright` is a
  pinned devDependency, so `npm ci && npx playwright install chromium && npm
  run qa:browser` works from a clean checkout, and the GitHub Pages workflow
  runs the full browser suite (encrypted unlock, locked-write protection,
  corrupt-store quarantine, backup round trip, plugin consent, dataset
  switching, XSS, dialogs, mobile overflow) after the build — a red browser QA
  job now blocks deployment. Results and screenshots are uploaded as workflow
  artifacts on both pass and failure.
- **Dependency-audit visibility (CS-107):** the deploy workflow keeps blocking
  on high/critical advisories, but now also stores the full `npm audit --json`
  report as a workflow artifact and summarizes all severity counts in the run
  summary so accepted moderate advisories stay visible.
- Browser QA gained coverage for the new dataset-form label wiring and PIN
  confirmation flow.

## [0.18.1] – 2026-07-10

Release-blocking fixes from the 2026-07-09 comprehensive audit, plus additional
defects found during a full review and browser-level QA pass.

### Fixed

- **Data loss on encrypted datasets (CS-001):** a PIN-protected dataset was
  parsed as an empty store on reload and then overwritten, destroying the
  encrypted data with no way to recover. Encrypted datasets are now detected
  before any parse, prompt for their PIN, and are never written over while
  locked. The PIN is no longer persisted anywhere — it lives only in the
  session and is re-entered after a reload. A lock screen offers unlock,
  encrypted-backup download, or dataset switch.
- **Every save reported as failed (CS-003):** `saveNow()` called a removed
  `scheduleCloudSync()` function, so each successful local write surfaced a
  "Local save failed" error. The obsolete call is gone; saves report success.
- **Corrupt storage overwritten (CS-004):** unreadable stored data was
  immediately replaced with an empty store. It is now quarantined under a
  timestamped recovery key, the active key is left untouched, and a recovery
  screen offers download / retry / start-fresh — nothing is overwritten
  without explicit confirmation.
- **Broken backup/restore (CS-005):** instance export now includes every
  user-owned field (bookmarks, recent cards, view mode, theme, dataset
  metadata, schema version) and restores plugins in the executable
  `{definition, enabled}` shape, so an export → import round-trip actually
  restores plugins and settings.
- **All confirm/prompt dialogs threw at runtime (NEW-1):** the shared dialog
  primitives had been nested inside a `showToast` closure, so every
  delete/clear/import confirmation raised a `ReferenceError`. They are now
  module-level.
- **Created datasets were invisible / unusable (NEW-2, NEW-4):** the Dataset
  Manager only listed one key shape, and the "Open" button referenced an
  out-of-scope variable and threw. Dataset enumeration is unified, switching
  awaits the load and reconciles plugins, and the selector refreshes.
- **"All datasets" search only searched the current one (NEW-3):**
  multi-dataset search now enumerates on-device datasets, skips locked
  encrypted ones, labels results by dataset, and switches datasets when you
  open a result from another dataset.
- **Escape under a dialog also navigated the app (NEW-5):** pressing Escape in
  a confirm/prompt dialog both closed it and triggered the global "go back"
  handler. The global handler now yields to open dialogs.
- **`npm run preview` served a 404 (CS-006):** the build now emits a complete
  site into `dist/`, so preview (and any static host of `dist/`) serves the app.

### Changed

- **Plugin trust model (CS-002):** JavaScript plugins run unsandboxed in the
  page realm, so declared permissions are not a security boundary. Any plugin
  that ships JavaScript now requires explicit full-trust consent before it is
  enabled (at install, re-import, and first enable); only CSS-only themes
  auto-enable. Documentation and Plugin Manager language were corrected to
  describe this honestly.
- **Modal accessibility (CS-008):** a shared observer applies the dialog
  contract (`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, labelled title, focus trap,
  Escape, focus restoration) to all dynamically created overlays, and the
  plugin permission dialog was rebuilt to the same contract.
- **CI now gates deployment on QA (CS-009):** the Pages workflow runs the unit
  suite, `npm audit`, the production build, and static smoke checks before the
  deploy artifact is produced.
- **Native platform setup documented (CS-007):** `npm run platform:android` /
  `platform:ios` scripts and docs explain that `android/`/`ios/` are generated,
  not committed.
- Dataset encryption was extracted to `www/src/core/dataset-crypto.js` with
  real behavior tests, and the fragile post-build function-body restoration now
  fails loudly instead of silently shipping a stale body (CS-011, first step).
- Documentation/version drift corrected (CS-010): removed stale test counts and
  the IndexedDB-as-primary wording; storage default is LocalStorage.

### Testing

- Added `tests/audit-regressions.test.js` (envelope encryption, load-path
  invariants, backup shape, full-trust consent).
- Added `scripts/static-smoke.mjs` (`npm run smoke`) and
  `scripts/browser-qa.mjs` (`npm run qa:browser`, 11 headless-Chromium
  scenarios covering the flows above).

## [0.18.0] – 2026-07-09

First public release of the main CardSpoke web app.

### Public Scope

- Main CardSpoke web app.
- Local-first card knowledge workflow.
- Desktop packaging as the next packaging target.
- Mobile packaging after desktop, with mobile security hardening tracked separately.

### Added

- Public app scope document: `docs/specifications/FIRST_PUBLIC_SCOPE.md`.
- Clear first-public-version positioning for the main CardSpoke web app.
- Regression tests for new-card tag persistence, search keyboard navigation, form labels, dialog semantics, focus-trap cleanup, tab contrast tokens, CSP hardening, and balanced HTML.

### Fixed

- Tags entered while creating a new card are now persisted on the first save (previously they were silently dropped; QA FUNC-1).
- Search-results keyboard navigation now works as the on-screen hint promises: the search bar stays visible on the results page and Arrow/Enter are handled even after focus leaves the input (QA UX-1).
- Card edit form controls (`Title`, `Parent Card`, child title inputs) now have programmatic labels for screen readers (QA A11Y-2).
- The menu overlay and Plugin Manager are exposed as modal dialogs (`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, labelled titles) and all glyph-only close buttons have accessible names (QA A11Y-3).
- Closing the menu with Escape (or any other path) now always releases the focus-trap listener, so repeated open/close cycles no longer accumulate keydown handlers (QA A11Y-4).
- Header, search, and density controls meet the 44px touch-target goal on mobile widths (QA A11Y-1).
- Active Plugin Manager tab text uses a theme-aware accent token with WCAG AA (≥ 4.5:1) contrast in light and dark themes (QA A11Y-5).
- Removed a stray closing `</div>` from `index.html` (QA HTML-1).

### Security

- Content Security Policy hardened (QA SEC-1/SEC-2): `connect-src` no longer contains a wildcard and is limited to same-origin plus the curated plugin gallery (`raw.githubusercontent.com`); Google/Microsoft script, connect, and frame sources are gone; `frame-src` is now `'none'`. `'unsafe-eval'` remains only for the plugin runtime and is documented in `docs/policies/SECURITY_AND_SAFETY.md`.
- Third-party auth libraries (Google Identity Services, MSAL) no longer load at startup — the app makes no third-party contact by default (QA PRIV/PERF-1).
- Resolved all `npm audit` advisories in the build toolchain (Vite, esbuild, tar, brace-expansion) — 0 known vulnerabilities (QA DEP-1).

### Changed

- Refocused README, feature catalog, developer guide, test guide, and storage docs around the main CardSpoke app.
- Package description now describes CardSpoke as a local-first card-based knowledge app.
- Removed `build:core` from public package scripts.
- Public product priority is now web app first, desktop packaging second, mobile packaging third.
- Cloud/off-device storage is deferred to a future version instead of presented as a current public feature.
- The save-status indicator reports plain local-save state; there is no remote sync state in the public app.
- Schema/docs updated: `www/src/core/migrations.js` now provides baseline structural repair (`migrateCard`/`migrateStore`) only.

### Removed

- Cloud storage drivers (Google Drive, OneDrive, WebDAV) and the cloud sync scheduler — out of scope for the public app. Legacy dataset metadata referencing cloud drivers falls back safely to LocalStorage. No schema change: `schemaVersion` remains 4.
- Committed OAuth client IDs for Google/Microsoft integrations.
- Typed-card platform layer, conversions, action registry, runtime profiles, kind-filterable export, and the core-only entry point (`www/src/core/index.js`) — all "OS preparation" code outside the public scope.
- Stale core-only build artifacts (`dist/cardspoke-core.*`) and the unused legacy ES module mirror (`www/modules/`).
- OS-light roadmap and OS preparation directive from the public app repo.
- Runtime profile, app-mode, typed-card, conversion, action-registry, and core/shell split architecture docs from current public scope.
- App-mode boot wiring from the main app entry point.
- Core-only build config.
- Tests for extracted/deferred platform systems: app modes, runtime profiles, typed cards, typed queries, typed migrations, conversions, action registry, and core-only entry behavior.

### Explicitly Deferred

- OS-specific shells.
- Spin-off apps or app suites built on CardSpoke.
- Typed-card domain systems.
- Runtime profiles.
- Core-only builds.
- Google Drive, OneDrive, WebDAV, and other cloud storage drivers.
- Hosted sync or real-time collaboration.

## [0.17.0] – 2026-02-17

### Added

- Backlinks panel: the Read view shows all cards that link to the current card via `[[Title]]` references.
- Related-cards panel: the Read view shows cards sharing tags with the current card, ranked by match score.
- `CHANGELOG.md` created.

### Fixed

- Vite build no longer emits an `outDir`-overlaps-`root` warning.
- `npm run build` produces an unminified, readable IIFE bundle.
- Removed duplicate `build:vite` script from `package.json`.

### Changed

- README build-step description updated to reflect the Vite bundler.
- README quick example updated to use the correct public API.
- README duplicate support section removed.
