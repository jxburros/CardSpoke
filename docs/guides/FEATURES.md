# CardSpoke Feature Catalog

This catalog describes the current public CardSpoke app scope: the main local-first web app, followed by desktop and mobile packaging. It intentionally excludes OS-specific shells, spin-off apps, typed-card platform systems, runtime profiles, core-only builds, and cloud storage drivers.

**Current Public Preview:** 0.19.0 | **Schema Version:** 4

## Core Product Shape

- **Card-based knowledge app:** Presents information as hierarchical cards for lightweight knowledge organization.
- **Local-first by default:** Data stays on the user's device unless the user explicitly imports or exports it.
- **Minimal default app:** Keeps the built-in experience focused and fast while leaving optional complexity to plugins.
- **Plugin-ready foundation:** Theme, Feature, and App plugins can extend the app without bloating the default experience.
- **Portable data:** Users can export backups and readable formats directly from the app.

## User Data & Storage

## Deviations and Forks

- Deviations must provide mandatory metadata, credit CardSpoke/JX Holdings, and avoid implying official endorsement.
- Monetization is permitted when authorship and endorsement status are transparent.

## Platform & Build Footprint

- **Web app first:** The main public target is the CardSpoke web app.
- **Prebuilt web bundle:** `www/app.js` is built by Vite from `www/src/`.
- **Desktop next:** Desktop packaging should wrap the same main app experience.
- **Mobile later:** Capacitor workflows support Android and iOS iteration, but production mobile hardening is not part of the first public promise.

## Schema, Versioning, and Compatibility

- **Current schema version:** 4.
- **Default store shape:** `rootOrder`, `cards`, `plugins`, `bookmarks`, `recentCards`, `viewMode`, `activeTheme`, `richTextEnabled`.
- **Migration rules:** Schema bumps require documented migrations, idempotent steps, explicit fallbacks, and plugin impact notes.
- **Compatibility safeguards:** Plugins must declare compatibility and refuse to run on unsupported versions.

## LocalStorage Keys

CardSpoke uses LocalStorage for preferences and lightweight configuration. Public keys are prefixed with `cardspoke_`.

### User Preferences

- `cardspoke_richtext`
- `cardspoke_gridView`
- `cardspoke_highcontrast`
- `cardspoke_typography`
- `cardspoke_devmode`
- `cardspoke_theme`
- `cardspoke_activeThemeMod`

### Application State

- `cardspoke_datasets`
- `cardspoke_dataset_metadata`
- `cardspoke_lastUploadTab`
- `cardspoke_hasSeenGettingStarted`

## Developer & Testing Experience

- **Node/uvu toolchain:** Uses Node 18+, Vite, and uvu.
- **Canonical build:** `npm run build` is the main app build path.
- **Automated tests:** `npm test` runs the app and plugin tests that remain in the public app scope.
- **Capacitor workflows:** Capacitor scripts remain available for native packaging iteration.

## Community & Governance Features

- **Transparency:** Community plugins must publish versioning, creator identity, and changelogs.
- **Credit & ownership rules:** CardSpoke stays free-to-use under JX Holdings, LLC ownership; creators must credit CardSpoke/JX Holdings and avoid implying official endorsement.
- **Quality expectations:** Plugins should fail safely, avoid data corruption or obfuscation, and document install/removal steps.
