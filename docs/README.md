## Documentation map

- [`architecture/`](./architecture/) — implementation boundaries, plugin design, and compatibility invariants.
- [`api/`](./api/) — public plugin, schema, middleware, component, and storage contracts.
- [`guides/`](./guides/) — development, testing, Capacitor, offline-first, feature, and deviation guides.
- [`policies/`](./policies/) — release, security, privacy, and community policies.
- [`specifications/`](./specifications/) — product scope and longer-term specification material.
- [`reports/`](./reports/) — dated historical audits; these record past findings and are not current release documentation.

## Documentation status and authority

The current product contract is owned by the source code, `package.json`, the app metadata in `www/src/state.js`, and the current policy/reference documents. Historical reports and changelog entries describe their release dates only. If documents disagree, follow the precedence in [AI & Contributor Context](./AI_CONTEXT.md) and correct the lower-authority document in the same change.
