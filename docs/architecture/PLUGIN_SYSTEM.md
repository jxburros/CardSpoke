# CardSpoke Plugin System

This is the canonical guide to CardSpoke's plugin system: what plugins are,
how to build one for each of the three layers, how the lifecycle works
(install, enable, suspend, delete, reload), and the complete `ctx` API
reference.

**App Version:** 0.21.0 | **Schema Version:** 4

Companion documents:

- [`PLUGIN_INVARIANTS.md`](./PLUGIN_INVARIANTS.md) — the stability contract:
  everything that must **not** change or the plugin system breaks. Read it
  before touching runtime code.
- [`../sample-plugins/`](../sample-plugins/) — nine working packages (three
  per layer) plus `TEMPLATE.json`. Every sample installs, enables, suspends,
  deletes, and survives reload; `tests/plugin-lifecycle.test.js` proves it on
  every test run.

## Overview

CardSpoke stays intentionally small; plugins are the supported way to change
it — from a coat of paint to a different product. The system has three
architectural layers, preserved from the original design:

| Layer | Contents | Risk | Enable behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `theme` | CSS only | SAFE | Auto-enabled on install (no JavaScript runs, no worker spun up) |
| `feature` | CSS + JS | LOW (unless it declares overrides) | Auto-enabled at install (JS runs inside its own sandboxed worker) |
| `app` | CSS + JS + overrides | HIGH | Installed **suspended**; the user must enable it manually |

The runtime lives in `www/src/core/` (ES modules) and is exposed to both the
app and to plugins as `window.CardSpoke`. There is exactly one plugin runtime
and one build (`npm run build`, Vite + a separate worker bundle step). The
safety model is **isolation-based**, not consent-based (CS-002, resolved):

1. **The sandbox (the real boundary)**: every JS-bearing plugin package runs
   inside its own dedicated Web Worker
   (`www/src/core/plugin-worker-bootstrap.js`). That worker has no `window`,
   `document`, `localStorage`, or raw `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest`/`WebSocket`/
   `indexedDB`/`caches` — the only way it can affect the app at all is
   `ctx.api.*`, which is a permission-checked RPC round trip into the host.
   A denied permission is genuinely unreachable from inside the worker, not
   just discouraged.
2. The **validator** still screens every package before registration
   (manifest shape, CSS/JS size limits, obvious footguns) as defense in
   depth, but it is no longer the thing standing between a plugin and your
   data — the sandbox is.
3. **Permission consent** is now an accurate capability grant: the first
   time a plugin needs `ui-override`, `data-modify`, `storage`, `network`,
   or `filesystem`, the user is asked once, and the grant is enforced by the
   worker's construction (dangerous globals never exist there in the first
   place), not by a cooperating wrapper a plugin could route around.
4. **Risk labels** by layer set expectations; `app`-layer plugins never run
   until the user enables them.
5. **`?safemode`** in the URL boots the app with every plugin registered but
   disabled — no worker is created for any of them.
6. Everything a plugin creates through `ctx.api.*` is **tracked and
   automatically removed** when the plugin is suspended or deleted,
   including its dedicated worker (which is terminated outright — a genuine
   `while(true){}` in a plugin's `js` only pins that one worker's thread and
   is killed on suspend/timeout, never freezing the app).

Sandboxing contains what a plugin's *code* can reach on its own — it does not
limit what a plugin is allowed to do with a capability once you grant it (a
plugin with `data-modify` can still delete every card; one with `network` can
still send data somewhere unexpected). Treat granting permissions like
installing software: only accept them for authors you trust.

## Quick Start: your first plugin in five minutes

1. Run the app (`npm run dev` or open the built `www/index.html`).
2. Open the hamburger menu → **Plugin Manager** → **Create** tab.
3. Manifest:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Hello CardSpoke",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "author": "You",
     "layer": "feature",
     "permissions": ["ui-override"]
   }
   ```

4. JavaScript — this is the **body of your setup function**, compiled as an
   `async function` and run inside your plugin's own sandboxed worker. It
   receives the plugin context as `ctx`; there is no `document` or `window`
   in scope, so UI is described with `ctx.h(...)` instead of
   `document.createElement(...)`:

   ```javascript
   var el = ctx.h('span', {}, 'Hello!');
   await ctx.api.ui.inject('.header', el, 'append');
   ctx.api.ui.showToast('Hello plugin enabled', 'success');
   ```

5. Click **Save & Register**, grant the `ui-override` permission, and the
   badge appears in the header. Reload the page — it's still there. Suspend
   or remove it from the **Installed** tab; the badge disappears immediately
   (and its worker is terminated).

## Plugin Package Format

A plugin is a single JSON file:

```json
{
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "manifest": {
    "id": "my-plugin",
    "name": "My Plugin",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "description": "What it does",
    "layer": "feature",
    "permissions": ["ui-override"],
    "compatibility": ">=0.21.0",
    "config": { "workMinutes": 25 },
    "overrides": { "appName": "My App" },
    "dependencies": ["other-plugin-id"]
  },
  "css": "/* injected while enabled, removed when suspended */",
  "js": "/* SETUP BODY — runs as async function(ctx) { ...this string... } inside a dedicated worker, on every enable */",
  "teardownJs": "/* optional extra cleanup — same ctx object as setup, same worker */"
}
```

Field reference:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` (top level) | recommended | Lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens. Normalized into `manifest.id` at install; if both are absent the id is derived by slugging `manifest.name`. |
| `manifest.name` | **yes** | Human-readable name (string). |
| `manifest.version` | **yes** | Semver string. |
| `manifest.layer` | **yes** | `theme`, `feature`, or `app`. |
| `manifest.author` | recommended | Shown in the Plugin Manager. |
| `manifest.description` | recommended | Shown in the Plugin Manager and gallery. |
| `manifest.permissions` | if JS uses gated APIs | See [Permissions](#permissions). |
| `manifest.config` | no | Key/value defaults; surfaced to code as `ctx.config` and to users as an auto-generated settings panel. Value types (boolean/number/string) drive the input type. Changes persist. |
| `manifest.overrides` | no | App-layer host overrides. Currently implemented: `appName` (renames the app brand button). Declaring any override forces HIGH risk. |
| `manifest.dependencies` | no | Array of plugin ids that must already be installed. |
| `manifest.compatibility` | no | Informational version range. |
| `css` | themes: yes | Max 100 KB. Sanitized: `@import`, `javascript:`, `expression()`, `behavior:`, `-moz-binding` are stripped. |
| `js` | features/apps: yes | Max 500 KB. **The body of your setup function**, compiled as an `async function(ctx)` and run inside a dedicated Worker — see below. `eval(` and bare `new Function(` are rejected by the validator. |
| `teardownJs` | no | Extra cleanup code (timers, subscriptions). Tracked resources are cleaned automatically without it. Runs in the same worker as `js`. |

`config` and `overrides` may also appear at the package top level (the
installer normalizes them into the manifest; explicit manifest values win).

### How `js` executes — inside a sandboxed worker

The `js` string is compiled once per **enable**, inside a brand-new, dedicated
Worker for that plugin instance:

```text
new AsyncFunction('ctx', '"use strict";\n' + js)
```

and invoked as `await setup(ctx)`. That worker has no DOM, no `window`, no
`localStorage`, and no raw `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest`/`WebSocket`/`indexedDB`/
`caches` — those identifiers are stripped before your code ever runs. That
means:

- Write **statements**, not a wrapper: `await ctx.api.ui.showToast('hi')`,
  not `(function() { ... })()` around a registration call.
- **Use `await` freely.** The body compiles as an `AsyncFunction`, so
  top-level `await` works directly against the (now fully async) `ctx.api` —
  no need to wrap everything in an inner `async` IIFE.
- **Build UI with `ctx.h(tag, props, children)`, not `document.createElement`**
  — see [Building UI](#building-ui-ctxh-and-the-vnode-model) below.
  `document`/`window` simply don't exist inside the worker; referencing them
  throws `ReferenceError`.
- **Never call `window.CardSpoke.registerPlugin(...)` from `js`** — the
  package IS the plugin; installing it registers it. Self-registration
  throws a duplicate-id error. (It's also unreachable — there is no
  `window` inside the worker.)
- The code re-runs on every enable (including at boot after a reload), and
  everything it created via `ctx.api.*` is removed on every disable
  (including terminating the worker itself — any pending timers inside it
  die with it).
- State that `teardownJs` needs (interval ids, subscriptions) should be
  stashed on `ctx` (e.g. `ctx._myTimer = ...`) — teardown receives the same
  `ctx` object, in the same worker.
- A setup that never resolves (hangs, or spins in an infinite loop) is
  time-boxed; on timeout the worker is **terminated outright**, not just
  abandoned — a real capability the pre-sandbox architecture never had.

Plugins written as real modules (with `setup`/`teardown` **functions**, not
strings) can be registered programmatically — see
[Loading plugins](#loading-plugins-all-the-ways) — but only string-form
packages survive a reload (functions can't be persisted), and only
string-form packages are sandboxed. A function-form registration is
documented as session-only "host code" (it can only come from code the
embedding app itself calls, never from a downloaded/imported package) and
runs directly on the main thread with the pre-sandbox synchronous `ctx.api`
shape.

## Building UI: `ctx.h` and the vnode model

Because a plugin's worker has no DOM, `ctx.api.ui.inject`/`replace`/
`registerComponent` and vnode-returning `card.render` decorators all take a
**vnode** (a plain, serializable description of an element) instead of a real
`HTMLElement`. Build one with the `ctx.h` helper the runtime provides:

```javascript
ctx.h(tag, props, children)
```

- `tag`: an HTML tag name string (`'div'`, `'button'`, ...).
- `props`: a plain object — `className`, `style` (a CSS string or a
  `{prop: value}` object), `dataset` (a `{key: value}` object), any plain
  attribute (`href`, `title`, `aria-*`, ...), and `on<event>` handlers
  (`onclick`, `oninput`, `onchange`, `onkeydown`, ...) as plain functions.
- `children`: a string/number (text), a nested `ctx.h(...)` vnode, or an
  array of either, or omitted.

```javascript
var btn = ctx.h('button', {
  className: 'my-btn',
  onclick: function(event) {
    // event is a plain, safe descriptor — { type, key, code, clientX,
    // clientY, target: { value, checked, dataset } } — never a real DOM
    // Event object (Events aren't structured-clonable, and shouldn't be
    // exposed raw anyway). Return { preventDefault: true } and/or
    // { stopPropagation: true } if you need those.
    ctx.logger.info('clicked');
  }
}, 'Click me');

await ctx.api.ui.inject('.header', btn, 'append');
```

`ui.inject`/`ui.replace` return a handle instead of a bare undo function,
since a sandboxed plugin can't hold a live node reference to mutate later:

```javascript
var handle = await ctx.api.ui.inject('.header', vnode, 'append');
await handle.update(newVnode);   // replace this element's attrs/children in place
await handle.remove();           // undo the injection (also happens automatically on disable)
```

`ctx.api.ui.registerComponent('Card' | 'Header' | 'Sidebar' | 'SearchBar', { render, priority })`
works the same way, except `render(props)` now returns a vnode (it may be
`async`) instead of synchronously returning an `HTMLElement` — see
[Component overrides](#component-overrides).

## Lifecycle

```text
install(pkg) ──► validate ──► register ──► persist to store.plugins
                                   │
                     SAFE / LOW risk│ HIGH risk
                          auto─enable│ stays suspended
                                   ▼
        ┌───────────── enable(id) ◄────────── user clicks Enable
        │   permission consent → apply CSS → spin up worker → run setup(ctx)
        │   (failure: worker terminated, CSS + resources rolled back)
        ▼
     ENABLED ── disable(id) ──► teardown(ctx) → terminate worker → remove CSS
        ▲                        → cleanup resources → persist enabled=false
        └── enable(id) ◄──┘     ("suspend"; survives reload)

     unregister(id) = delete: disable + cleanup + revoke permissions
                      + remove from store.plugins (persisted)
```

Key guarantees (enforced by `tests/plugin-lifecycle.test.js`):

- **Add**: `install()` persists the package (source strings, not compiled
  functions) into the active dataset's `store.plugins` and saves.
  Reinstalling the same id **updates in place** — no `id-1` duplicates; the
  old instance is fully unregistered first.
- **Suspend**: `disable()` (the UI's *Suspend* button) runs teardown,
  terminates the plugin's worker, cleans up every tracked resource, and
  persists `enabled: false`. A suspended plugin stays suspended across
  reloads.
- **Delete**: `unregister()` also revokes the plugin's granted permissions
  and deletes the store entry.
- **Reload**: at boot (`systems.js`), after `load()` completes,
  `Plugin.syncFromStore()` re-registers every stored plugin from its
  persisted `js`/`teardownJs` strings and re-enables (spinning up a fresh
  worker for) the ones marked enabled. The sync is idempotent and re-runs
  automatically when an IndexedDB or local-file dataset finishes its async
  load.
- **Safe mode**: `index.html?safemode` registers everything but enables
  nothing — no workers are created.
- **Failure containment**: a package whose `js` fails to compile does not
  install (a cheap main-thread syntax pre-check catches this before any
  worker is ever created); a package whose setup throws, times out, or hangs
  stays installed but suspended (its worker terminated), with the error
  surfaced as a toast and in the console.

## The `ctx` API

Every sandboxed plugin gets its own worker-local context:

```text
ctx
├─ modId            plugin id (string)
├─ appVersion       e.g. '0.21.0'
├─ schemaVersion    e.g. 4
├─ config           manifest.config (live; settings panel writes propagate on next enable)
├─ h                ctx.h(tag, props, children) — build a vnode, see above
├─ logger           log / info / warn / error (prefixed console, relayed to the host)
├─ utils            async host helpers (same names as window.CardSpoke.utils)
└─ api
   ├─ ui            vnode injection + components + toasts   [ui-override]
   ├─ data          cards + tags + change events             [data-modify for writes]
   ├─ storage       namespaced key-value storage              [storage]
   ├─ events        global cross-plugin event bus
   ├─ middleware    core-operation interceptors + card.render decorators
   ├─ network       fetch                                     [network]
   └─ filesystem    Capacitor file access                     [filesystem]
```

Everything registered through `ctx.api.*` is tracked per plugin and removed
automatically on disable/unregister (including terminating the worker
itself). **Every method below is asynchronous** — always `await` it (or
handle the returned Promise) — even `ctx.api.data.getCard`, which used to be
synchronous before the sandbox.

### `ctx.api.ui` — permission: `ui-override`

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `inject(selector, vnode, position?)` | Build real DOM from `vnode` (see [Building UI](#building-ui-ctxh-and-the-vnode-model)) and insert it relative to the first match of `selector`. `position`: `'append'` (default), `'prepend'`, `'before'`, `'after'`. Returns `{ remove(), update(vnode) }`. Tracked. |
| `replace(selector, vnode)` | Replace the matched element; the original is restored on cleanup. Returns `{ remove(), update(vnode) }`. Tracked. |
| `registerComponent(name, { render, priority? })` | Register a UI component override (see [Component overrides](#component-overrides)). `render(props)` returns a vnode (may be `async`). Tracked. |
| `unregisterComponent(name)` | Remove a component registration. |
| `showToast(message, type?, duration?)` | Toast notification (`'info'`, `'success'`, `'error'`, `'warning'`). No permission required. |

### `ctx.api.data` — permission: `data-modify` for writes

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `getCard(id)` | Deep clone of one card, or `undefined`. No permission. |
| `listCards()` | Deep clones of all cards. No permission. |
| `createCard({ title, body, parentId, tags })` | Create a card (tags applied in the same call). Resolves to the new card id. |
| `updateCard(id, updates)` | Update fields; resolves to the updated clone. |
| `deleteCard(id)` | Delete a card (and its children). |
| `getTags(cardId)` / `getAllTags()` | Read tags. No permission. |
| `addTag(cardId, tag)` / `removeTag(cardId, tag)` / `setTags(cardId, tags)` | Mutate tags. |
| `onUpdate(callback)` | `callback` is invoked with `{ type: 'card.create' \| 'card.update' \| 'card.delete', cardId, card? }` after each data change (from any plugin). Returns an unsubscribe function. Tracked. |

### `ctx.api.storage` — permission: `storage`

Async key-value storage namespaced to `plugin_<id>_`. The namespace is now a
real boundary, not just a naming convention — a plugin has no way to reach
raw `localStorage`/`indexedDB` at all, so it cannot read or collide with
another plugin's stored values even by accident.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `get(key)` | Returns the stored JSON value (parsed), or `null`. |
| `set(key, value)` | Stores `JSON.stringify(value)`. |
| `remove(key)` | Deletes the key. |
| `list(prefix?)` | Keys in the plugin's namespace (namespace stripped). |
| `getNamespace()` | The `plugin_<id>_` prefix. |

### `ctx.api.events` — no permission

A **global** bus shared by all plugins (cross-plugin communication works,
even across different workers — the host relays). `on(event, cb)` (tracked,
returns unsubscriber), `off(event, cb)`, `once(event, cb)`,
`emit(event, ...args)`. Handler errors are caught and logged, never
propagated to the emitter.

### `ctx.api.middleware` — no permission

Intercept core operations. Registrations are namespaced (`<pluginId>:<name>`)
and tracked.

```javascript
ctx.api.middleware.register({
  name: 'my-interceptor',        // required
  priority: 10,                  // higher runs first (default 0)
  operations: ['card.save'],     // default ['*']
  handler: async function(mw, next) {
    // mw.operation, mw.args, mw.preventDefault(), mw.stopPropagation()
    await next();                // ALWAYS call next() unless intercepting
  }
});
```

Operations fired by the host app:

| Operation | `mw.args` | `preventDefault()` effect |
|---|---|---|
| `card.create` | `[cardId, card]` | none (fired after creation) |
| `card.update` | `[cardId, card]` | none (fired after update) |
| `card.delete` | `[cardId]` | none (fired after delete) |
| `card.save` | `[store]` | **aborts the save** |

`card.create`/`update`/`delete`/`save` keep the full onion-model contract
above (`next()`, `stopPropagation()`, `preventDefault()`) — the handler runs
inside your worker, and the host round-trips `next()` back into the real
pipeline (including other plugins' middleware, possibly in other workers)
exactly as if it ran locally.

**`card.render` is different — see the next section.** It does not use the
`(mwCtx, next)` shape above at all.

### The `card.render` decorator contract

`card.render` fires once per card tile, in a hot render-batch loop (up to 60
tiles per batch, on every scroll/search/navigation) — too frequent for a
cross-thread `next()` round trip per decorator. It uses a different,
simpler handler shape, registered through the same `ctx.api.middleware.register`
call:

```javascript
ctx.api.middleware.register({
  name: 'my-decorator',
  operations: ['card.render'],
  // (card, tileSnapshot) => patch | Promise<patch> | null — NOT (mwCtx, next)
  handler: async function(card, tileSnapshot) {
    // tileSnapshot: { classList, hasBody, hasTags, tagTexts, isCompact } —
    // a serializable summary of the already-built default tile. There is
    // no live DOM node here (see PLUGIN_INVARIANTS.md §7 for why).
    if (!tileSnapshot.hasTags) return null;
    return {
      addClass: ['my-flag'],
      removeClass: [],
      setStyle: { '': { opacity: '0.8' } },                 // '' = the tile root
      setStyleByIndex: { '.card-tag': [{ color: 'red' }] }, // per-matched-element, by DOM order
      appendChildren: { '.card-content': [ctx.h('span', {}, 'note')] },
      prependChildren: {}
    };
  }
});
```

The host applies each registered decorator's patch to the real tile, in
registration order, after all decorators for that render batch resolve (or
after a short deadline — a slow/hung decorator just doesn't apply that pass;
it never blocks or stutters scrolling). There is no `next()`/
`stopPropagation()`/`preventDefault()` for this operation — every registered
decorator's patch is independent and additive by design. See
`sample-plugins/features/card-color-tags.json` and `card-reading-time.json`
for complete working examples.

A custom `registerComponent('Card', { render })` (full tile replacement) and
`card.render` decorators (partial patches to the default tile) share the same
underlying batched round trip — installing a `Card` component costs nothing
extra if no `card.render` decorator is also registered, and vice versa.
Newly enabling either kind of Card customization applies starting from the
next natural render pass (navigation, search keystroke, or scroll) — there is
no retroactive repaint of tiles already on screen at the moment of enable.

### `ctx.api.network` — permission: `network`

`fetch(url, options)` — a permission-gated wrapper that always performs the
real request on the **main thread** on the plugin's behalf (never inside the
worker, even once granted) and returns a serializable Response-shaped object
(`ok`, `status`, `statusText`, `url`, `headers.get(name)`,
`text()`/`json()`/`arrayBuffer()`). `xhr()` is not available in the sandboxed
runtime — `XMLHttpRequest`'s stateful, event-driven shape doesn't cross a
Worker boundary safely; use `fetch` instead.

### `ctx.api.filesystem` — permission: `filesystem`

`readFile(path, options)` / `writeFile(path, data, options)` via Capacitor
(mobile builds); throws on platforms without a filesystem. Like `network`,
the real Capacitor bridge call always happens on the main thread.

### `ctx.utils`

Async convenience helpers provided by the host app (also at
`window.CardSpoke.utils`): `createCard`, `updateCard`, `getCard`,
`searchCards`, tag helpers, `showToast`, `getDatasetMeta`, theme and
typography getters/setters, and accessibility queries. See
`www/src/storage.js` (the `CardSpoke.utils API` block) for the full list.

## Permissions

| Permission | Grants |
|---|---|
| `ui-override` | DOM injection/replacement, component registration |
| `data-modify` | Creating, updating, deleting cards and tags |
| `storage` | The plugin's namespaced key-value storage |
| `network` | `ctx.api.network.fetch` |
| `filesystem` | Capacitor file access (mobile) |
| `core-override` | Reserved for future core-function overrides |

Declare what you use in `manifest.permissions`. On first enable the user
sees a consent dialog listing each permission with its description; denial
fails the enable, and — unlike before the sandbox — a denied permission is
not merely "not offered by the convenience API," it is **unreachable** from
inside the plugin's worker at all. Grants persist (localStorage key
`cardspoke_plugin_permissions`) until the plugin is deleted — deleting a
plugin revokes its grants, so a reinstall must ask again.

Calling a gated API without the permission throws
`Plugin does not have <permission> permission`.

## Component overrides

Register with priority; the highest-priority registration wins:

```javascript
ctx.api.ui.registerComponent('Card', {
  priority: 10,
  render: async function(props) {
    // props: { card, isSelected, opts }
    return ctx.h('button', {
      onclick: function() { /* selecting a card is handled by the host */ }
    }, '🃏 ' + (props.card.title || 'Untitled'));
  }
});
```

Component names the app queries:

| Name | Render props | When applied |
|---|---|---|
| `Card` | `{ card, isSelected, opts }` | Batched per render pass (scroll/search/navigation) — see [the card.render section](#the-cardrender-decorator-contract) |
| `Header` | `{ header }` | Once at boot (`applyRegistryComponents`) — takes effect on next reload |
| `Sidebar` | `{ panel }` | Once at boot — next reload |
| `SearchBar` | `{ wrapper }` | Once at boot — next reload |

If a custom component throws or its render doesn't resolve within a short
deadline, the app falls back to the default renderer for that render pass.
For live header/sidebar changes use `ctx.api.ui.inject`/`replace` instead —
those are tracked and reversible without a reload.

## Loading plugins (all the ways)

1. **Plugin Manager UI** (hamburger menu → Plugin Manager):
   - *Install* tab — upload a `.json` package or install from a URL.
   - *Gallery* tab — curated list from
     `sample-plugins/manifest.json` on GitHub, one-click install.
   - *Create* tab — write manifest/JS/CSS in the app; saved persistently.
   - *Installed* tab — Enable / Suspend / Remove, with risk and state badges.
2. **Programmatic install** (persistent, sandboxed — string-form `js`):

   ```javascript
   await window.CardSpoke.Plugin.install(pkg);   // or
   await window.CardSpoke.installPlugin(pkg);
   ```

3. **Session-only registration** (real functions, host code, **not
   sandboxed** — for development; not persisted, gone after reload):

   ```javascript
   await window.CardSpoke.registerPlugin('dev-plugin', {
     manifest: { name: 'Dev Plugin', version: '1.0.0', layer: 'feature' },
     setup: async (ctx) => { /* real function — session only, runs on the main thread */ },
     teardown: async (ctx) => { /* optional */ },
     css: ''
   }); // registers AND enables
   ```

4. **ES-module dev loader** — `www/src/examples/dynamic-plugin-loader.js`
   shows `import()`-based loading of module plugins from URLs/files. These
   register with real `setup`/`teardown` functions, so — like all
   function-form registrations — they run unsandboxed, on the main thread;
   only download/import code you already trust through this path.

## The `window.CardSpoke` surface

Assembled and frozen by `www/src/core/global-api.js` before any app code
runs. Members (shape is a stability contract — see
[`PLUGIN_INVARIANTS.md`](./PLUGIN_INVARIANTS.md)):

| Member | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `registerPlugin(id, definition)` | Register + enable (session-only, host code, unsandboxed). |
| `installPlugin(pkg)` | Persistent install (alias of `Plugin.install`; sandboxed if `pkg.js` is a string). |
| `requestPermissions(id, name, perms)` | Ask the user for permissions. |
| `Plugin` | Full manager: `install`, `register`, `enable`, `disable`, `unregister`, `get`, `list`/`listAll`, `assessModRisk`, `syncFromStore`, `notifyDataUpdate`, `buildSettingsPanel`, `getCardRenderPluginIds`, `renderBatch`. |
| `PluginSandbox(js)` | Syntax-check a setup-body string (throws on bad JS, otherwise returns `undefined`) — the runtime's single main-thread compile point. Does **not** execute the code; real execution always happens inside a plugin's own worker. |
| `Middleware` | The pipeline (host-fired operations; prefer `ctx.api.middleware`). |
| `ComponentRegistry` | Component registry (prefer `ctx.api.ui.registerComponent`). |
| `StorageDriverRegistry` | Registry for custom storage drivers (experimental; the host app does not yet consume it). |
| `PluginValidator` | `validate(pkg)`, `validateCSS(css)`, `validateJS(js)`. |
| `Permissions` | `hasPermission`, `grantPermissions`, `revokePermissions`, … |
| `utils` | Async host helpers (see `ctx.utils`). |

Prefer `ctx.api.*` inside plugin code — it is permission-checked, sandboxed,
and resource-tracked. The globals exist for the host app, for development,
and for advanced host-code integrations.

## Distributing plugins

- Publish the `.json` package anywhere; users install via URL.
- To appear in the in-app Gallery, add an entry to
  `sample-plugins/manifest.json` (`id`, `name`, `description`, `layer`,
  `url`) in a PR. `tests/sample-extensions.test.js` verifies gallery
  entries point at real packages.
- Start from [`sample-plugins/TEMPLATE.json`](../sample-plugins/TEMPLATE.json).

## Testing your plugin

`tests/plugin-lifecycle.test.js` shows the harness pattern: a fake
`window`/`document`, a real Node `worker_threads`-backed `Worker` global
(`tests/helpers/fake-worker-global.js`, which runs the actual
`plugin-worker-bootstrap.js` source under test — real thread isolation, not a
mock), the real runtime imported from `www/src/core/plugin-api.js`,
permissions pre-granted with `Permissions.grantPermissions(id, perms)`, then:

```javascript
const id = await Plugin.install(myPkg);
await Plugin.disable(id);
// simulate reload:
const persisted = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(window.store));
resetForTesting(); window.store = persisted;
await Plugin.syncFromStore(false);
```

Run everything with `npm test`. If you add a sample package, the
sample-extensions suite validates it automatically.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| "Plugin validation failed …" | Manifest missing `name`/`version`/`layer`, or JS contains `eval(`/`new Function(`, or size limits exceeded. |
| "Plugin … is already registered" | Your `js` calls `registerPlugin` — remove it; packages self-register via `install()`. |
| "Plugin does not have X permission" | Add the permission to `manifest.permissions` and re-enable (consent dialog appears). This is now enforced, not just descriptive — there is no way around it from inside the worker. |
| `ReferenceError: document is not defined` (or `window`) | Your `js` is using `document.createElement`/`window.*` directly — rewrite the UI with `ctx.h(...)` (see [Building UI](#building-ui-ctxh-and-the-vnode-model)); there is no DOM inside the sandbox. |
| `cardsPromise.filter is not a function` (or similar) | You called an async `ctx.api.data.*`/`ctx.api.storage.*`/etc. method without `await`. Every `ctx.api` method is async now. |
| Plugin installed but did nothing after reload | It was registered with `setup` as a function (session-only, host code). Ship `js` as a string so it persists and is sandboxed. |
| App broken by a plugin | Boot with `index.html?safemode`, then suspend or remove the plugin in the Plugin Manager. |
| Header/Sidebar/SearchBar override not applying | Those apply at boot — reload. Use `ctx.api.ui.replace` for live changes. |
| Plugin seems unresponsive / suspended itself | A hung worker (never-resolving setup, or a steady-state RPC call stuck too long) is auto-terminated and the plugin auto-suspended, with a toast. Check the plugin's own logic for a call that never resolves. |

## Architecture (for contributors)

```text
www/src/main.js                     Vite entry: global-api first, then app layer
www/src/core/global-api.js          window.CardSpoke assembly (frozen surface)
www/src/core/plugin-api.js          PluginManager, host-side ctx.api handlers, worker lifecycle
www/src/core/plugin-worker-manager.js  Per-plugin Worker creation/termination (host side)
www/src/core/plugin-worker-bootstrap.js  The sandbox itself — worker entry point, ctx construction
www/src/core/plugin-rpc.js          Shared request/response + function-handle protocol (both sides)
www/src/core/plugin-vnode.js        ctx.h() (worker) + vnode→DOM / patch application (host)
www/src/core/plugin-validator.js    Package validation and CSS/JS sanitizing
www/src/core/permissions.js         Consent dialogs + persisted grants
www/src/core/middleware.js          Priority pipeline for core operations
www/src/core/component-registry.js  Component overrides
www/src/core/storage-driver-registry.js  Custom storage drivers (experimental)
www/src/systems.js                  HOST BRIDGE globals + boot (syncFromStore)
www/src/rendering.js                Card render hot path + plugin decoration upgrade pass
www/src/data.js                     Plugin Manager UI + middleware/data hooks
scripts/build-plugin-worker.mjs     Bundles plugin-worker-bootstrap.js into www/plugin-worker-bootstrap.js
```

The invariants that keep all of this working — boot order, the host-bridge
globals, the persistence schema, validator limits, middleware operation
names, the sandbox execution model — are specified in
[`PLUGIN_INVARIANTS.md`](./PLUGIN_INVARIANTS.md). Change those only with a
migration plan.
